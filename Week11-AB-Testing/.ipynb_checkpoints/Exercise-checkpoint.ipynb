    "Letâ€™s imagine you work on the For You Page at TikTok. Your team decides that instead of a heart button, they want to change it to star hoping that it will lead to a higher engagement/like rate. The product manager told you that the current conversion rate is about 6% on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of 3%, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the engagement rate to 9%.\n",

    "Before rolling out the change, the team would be more comfortable testing it on a small number of users to see how it performs, so you suggest running an A/B test on a subset of the user base users."
